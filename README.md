# BookStore-Application
A bookstore application 

The application developed is a JavaFX-based library management system 
designed to cater to the needs of a library. It incorporates three levels of 
user roles: Librarian, Manager, and Administrator. The librarian can sell 
books from the library. The manager can order new books or resupply 
existing books to the library. Managers also receive timely notifications 
when the quantity of a particular book falls below five, enabling them to 
restock and maintain inventory levels. The administrator has all the 
functionalities of the manager, but he can also add more employes to the 
library or promote or demote other librarians or managers or deny them 
some functionalities. He can also remove them from the library.
